## Hello, World! 

I am a research fellow at [Wadhwani AI](https://wadhwaniai.org/). I had graduated from from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2019, with degrees in Industrial Engineering & Computer Science. 

I'm interested in all things artificial intelligence and machine learning, however what truly fascinates me is applied artificial intelligence and data science, especially in a social context.

I did my undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Mausam](http://cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/). We worked on scraping a large dataset of court case summaries from Indian district courts, analyising them for positive and negative anomalies at various administrative granularities, and developing prediction models for case duration time. You can checkout this [website](btp_website/home) we made to showcase our work.

The summer of 2018 I had interned at [Wadhwani AI](https://wadhwaniai.org/) where I had worked on the anthropometry team, which is also the team I am currently a part of.

I did my master's thesis with [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~aseth/). Broadly we worked on analysing satellite data and Census data of various Indian districts to extract meaningful inferences on social development metrics, and develop models for predicting these metrics given satellite data.
