## Hello, World! 

I am a research fellow at [Wadhwani AI](https://wadhwaniai.org/). I had graduated from from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2019, with degrees in Industrial Engineering & Computer Science. At Wadhwani AI I have worked in applied AI in Healthcare problems - I was a part of the anthropometry team, and I am currently now a part of the covid modelling team.

I did my undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Mausam](http://cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/). We worked on scraping a large dataset of court case summaries from Indian district courts, and developing a framework for comparing districts. You can checkout this [website](btp_website/home) we made to showcase our work.

I did my master's thesis with [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~aseth/). We worked on building a data driven framework for analysing socio-economic development in districts, and analysing trends across multiple Censuses.
