		<p>A very happy valentine's day to you!! It's your very first one, I'm sure you would've been excited, but all my jibber-jabber about me not celebrating 14th of Feb brought your spirits (quite literally) down to the ground. So I made a small greeting card for you. It's really not much, but I hope you like it. You asked for a thousand roses, but maybe a thousand hearts will do the trick. To get the link to the card, you need to go down, which is something you're an expert at! <3 </p>
		<p>Now pleeeeasssee recover soon. You and I are both sick (very punny, aren't I) and tired of half-deaf Ria. I would like to go back to a state where the only thing contagious about you is your personality. Maybe spending some time today with the perfect antidote (*ahem*) will do the job! </p>
		<p>Also the radio silence today was not me being cool, I was just busy making this website (*insert monkey emoji*) </p>
		<p>PS - Look what you made me do, you're making me celebrate random capitalistic nonsense :p</p>
