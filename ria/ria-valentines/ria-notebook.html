    <div class="hipsum"><p>Hey babes,</p>
		<p> I know I have irritated you a lot by not replying to your tags, and you have been extremely patient in telling me to reply each and every time, and it's usually the 50th reminder which gets me to finally reply to your tag. I'm really sorry for having hurt you like that!! I've fucked up a bit :(. I'm just a bit lazy on text babe, especially on mediums like Facebook and Instagram. Sometimes I respond to people after days, maybe even a week or two. But you're my babes and I should not treat you like this, and I will try my level best not to. From next time, I'll try responding within a day of you tagging me (*insert monkey emoji*). It may not seem like a lot, but a small step in the eyes of Riality is a big leap for SKJ (:D) </p>

		<p> And please I never want you to feel as if you care too much, or that I am not involved in this as much as you are. I may not respond to messages instantly, or I may not shower you with gifts (that's because I am poor, no other reason), but I care for you and how you feel a LOTTT, and I am willing to do sooo much for you (especially in like the important things in life). Please don't draw any conclusions from my messaging and FB etiquette, that is not a reflection of how much I value you and care for you. You're too pure, nice and kind a person; an extremely rare breed - you hardly find pearls like these in an ocean of fucked up people. The last thing I want you to feel is not enough value for the love you shower. I hope the FB tagging and the lazy responding hasn't made you feel like that. If it has, then I am genuinely sorry, I will def improve upon them (let's start with only the replies to FB tagging though :p). You're been an absolute gem to me and I don't want to disrespect your love in any manner. </p>
	
    <p>Love you loads, <br> Sansiddh</p>
