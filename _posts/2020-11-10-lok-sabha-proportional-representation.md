Tis the elections season! Well, not in India ofc. All television networks have predicted Joe Biden as the 46th President of USA (counting is not over yet). 

## The Data

Election Commission of India releases data for national parties, state parties, regional (unrecognised) parties, and total aggregates separately. According to their data, the total valid votes counted are 606,633,413, or roughly 606M. It's easy to verify this number. According to this data, total no of individuals who voted in booths is 610,851,929, and total number of postal ballots are 2,804,369. This brings the total votes to 613,656,298. Total NOTA votes are 6,513,355. Total rejected votes are 509,530. If you subtract them from the total votes you would get 606,633,413, which are the total number of valid votes. 

A small caveat - according to election commission data, the total number of votes polled by national parties is 418,569,347, that by state parties is 140,578,537, and regional parties & independents is 47,387,976. If you add them all up, you get 606,535,860, which is still 97,553 votes short of the total valid votes, ie, 606,633,413. I don't know how to account for those 97,553 votes, but 97k is incredibly miniscule when compared to 606M, so we can ignore it for now.
