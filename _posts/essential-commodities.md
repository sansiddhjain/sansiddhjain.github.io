## What is the Essential Commodity Act?

The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is an Act that gives the government the power to control the production, supply and distribution of certain goods classified as essential. What are these "essential commodities"? They include several agricultural produce such as onion, potatoes, sugarcane and its products, rice, lentils, etc. However, it is not limited to only agricultural produce - petroleum and its products, drugs, are also essential commodities. 

Although the Act gives the government several powers pertaining to the trade and commerce of essential commodities, its main use case is in puting a cap on the inventory capacity of retail and wholesale sellers of different agricultural produce. The idea is to prevent the hoarding of said agricultural produce and provide the public that produce at a reasonable price. Or at least, that's what the intentions are.

The Act was enacted in 1955, when the history of horrible famines under the British rule was fresh, and there were several doomsday predictions for India from the Western world as they didn't think India would be able to feed itself. Our agricultural productivity was low, and a very sizable proportion of the population had a very low purchasing power, therefore hoarding was a genuine concern. It's the only way middle men could have made money. At that time, this Act seemed like a good way to prevent widespread hunger.

However, in the 60 years since, the green revolution happened, and our agricultural productivity went up manifold. We produce an incredible amount of food, in fact, we are the world's largest exporter of rice. At the same time, the purchasing power of a large number of citizens greatly improved - in fact this is talked about as Thalinomics in the recently released Economic Survey 2020 - the proportion of income a family of 5 has to spend on a vegetarian thali has greatly reduced. This is the country we live in now, a country greatly different from when the Act was enacted. In this world, a market distortion such as the ECA does far more harm than good.

The economic survey summarises it best : "The ECA affects the efficient development of agricultural markets by creating market distortions. As agriculture is a seasonal activity, it is essential to store produce for the off-season to ensure smoothened availaibility of a product at stable prices throughout the year. Therefore, producers face an inherent tradeoff between building an inventory in the harvest season and drawing down inventory in the lean season. ECA interferes with this mechanism by disincentivising investments in warehousing and storage facilities due to frequent and unpredictable imposition of stock limits. As stockholding limits apply to the entire agriculture supply chain, including wholesalers, food processing industries and retail food chains, the Act does not distinguish between firms that genuinely need to hold stocks owing to the nature of their operations, and firms that might speculatively hoard stocks"
